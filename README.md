# CDK-Gloabl-Assignment


Epic Context
A big retail brand outlet, on the eve of Christmas, we want to offer attractive seasonal discounts to our
customers to boost our retail sales.
Story#1
As a retail outlet’s salesman, I should be able to calculate the customer's shopping cart bill after considering
applicable discount rates that are based on the purchase amount and customer type so that our retail outlet
can maximize sales volume & value.
Discount Slabs for various purchase amounts for the regular and premium customers are as follows:
Customer Type: Regular Customer Type: Premium

Purchase Amount Slab Discount % Purchase Amount Slab Discount %
$0 - $ 5,000 Nil $ 0 - $ 4,000 10%
$ 5,000 - $10,000 10% $ 4,000 - $ 8,000 15%
$10,000 & above 20% $ 8,000 - $ 12,000 20%
$ 12,000 & above 30%
Note:
Total discount would be the sum of discount calculated for each slab.
E.g. For purchase of $15,000 by a regular customer would entitle total discount $1500 which is sum of
discount $500 for 2nd slab [10% of $(10000-5000)] & $1000 discount for 3rd slab [20% of $(15000-10000)].
Story Test-cases
Here are some of the test cases and corresponding input / output expectations:
Customer Type (input): Regular Customer Type (input): Premium
Purchase Amount
(input)
Bill Amount
(output)
Purchase Amount
(input)
Bill Amount
(output)
$ 5,000 $ 5,000 $ 4,000 $ 3,600
$ 10,000 $ 9,500 $ 8,000 $ 7,000
$ 15,000 $ 13,500 $ 12,000 $ 10,200
$20,000 $15,800

Solution Expectations’ Guidelines :
● You should demonstrate the working software by building an application / test program that exercises
the sample test-cases. Console inputs / outputs not needed.
● Maturity of your solution will be judged based on object oriented and / or functional programming design
and your ability to write clean, modular, extensible, maintainable and testable code.
● Coding-challenge here does not require any knowledge of underlying databases, OS platforms or
libraries (apart from standard development kit like JDK and xUnit framework).
● Based on this epic & story context, there could be other stories which could be asked to build-upon in
upcoming interview rounds.
Example: Introduce new customer types like Gold, Diamond, Platinum, etc and their discounts slabs.
